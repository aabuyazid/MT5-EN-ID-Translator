# MT5-EN-ID-Translator

To execute this project you need the following:
- Google Colab (potentially a paid version)

Follow these instructions:
- Place both `.ipynb` files into Google Colab.
- Run `Supervised-Finetune-EN-ID.ipynb` first. This will generate the correct
  model weights for RL training
- Run `REINFORNCE_EN_ID.ipynb` last. This will simulate REINFORCE training on
  the LLM
